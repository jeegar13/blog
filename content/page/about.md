Hi there! I’m Jeegar Dalal, and I’m passionate about Quality Assurance (QA) and Automation. With more than 11 years of experience in the field, I’ve honed my skills in QA Automation tools and technologies.

I have started this blog to share my insights, experiences, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. Whether you’re a seasoned QA professional or just starting out, I hope to provide valuable content that will help you in your journey.

When I’m not busy breaking software to make it better, you can find me watching cricket or movies. 

Thank you for visiting my blog. If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach me out at [my linkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeegar-dalal/).
